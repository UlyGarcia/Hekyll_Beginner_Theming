*Hekyll is a presentation generator that uses [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and [Impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js) to create awesome presentations. You write [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) files, which get turned into individual slides for an Impress.js presentation.
